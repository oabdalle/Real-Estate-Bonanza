(This a nice home!)

(Within the city so they can see their grandkids WHENEVER)

(There does seem to be more of an older presence in this area)

(Which I am sure will lend a lot to their social life)

(They won't feel out of place here)

(There is a mall nearby as well which I am sure will come in handy)

(Shannon will be able to start a garden here as well)

(There is no farming however haha)

(Overall it is a solid property that is within the budget)

(Time to head back!)
